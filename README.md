Tic Tac Toe Game: https://joseealejandro.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/

I followed the next steps to build this game:

1) I created users stories to understand the game requirements.
User Stories:
- As a player I want to sign up/ sign in to play the game.
- As a player I want to choose to be player 1 (X) or player 2 (O) to start play the game.
- As a player I want to win if I have three markers in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) confirmed by a notification message.
- As a player I want to change my password.
- As a player I want to log out to the game.

2) Based on the previous planning documentation I did the follow a game logic pseudocode. I pasted it in my main JS file to guide the construction of my code.

- Place marker
- Switch player
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until having a winner.

3) I tried to write a modular code. Every function I created I tested separately and at the end I articulated between them to make the game work.


Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML
- SCSS / CSS
- Bootstrap
- Git

Unsolved problems:
- Improve the look of the User Interface.
- Stop appering letters after having a winner.
- Make work the “play game” button.
